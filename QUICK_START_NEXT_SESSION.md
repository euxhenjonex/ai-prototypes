```
I'm continuing work on "Learn AI with RAG" project.

Please read:
/Users/eugenionex/ai-prototypes/PROJECT_CONTINUATION_GUIDE.md

Current status: Backend complete, need to restructure repository and create frontend.
Next step: Repository restructuring.
```

## 🚀 Next Actions (In Order)

### 1. Repository Restructuring
```bash
cd /Users/eugenionex/ai-prototypes

# Backup
git add .
git commit -m "Backup before restructuring"
git push

# Delete 01-text-api
rm -rf 01-text-api

# Create new structure
mkdir -p backend content/lessons frontend/.streamlit docs .github/workflows

# Move files (see full guide for complete commands)
```

### 2. Rename Repository
- GitHub Settings → Rename to `learn-ai-with-rag`
- Update local remote:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/euxhenjonex/learn-ai-with-rag.git
```

### 3. Create Frontend
