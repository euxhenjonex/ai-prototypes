## 💬 WHAT TO SAY IN INTERVIEWS

### The Pitch
*"I built an interactive AI tutor that teaches AI Engineering concepts using Retrieval Augmented Generation. It contains 12 comprehensive lessons I wrote on topics like LangChain, RAG architecture, vector databases, and production best practices. Users can ask any question and get accurate, educational answers. It's deployed with Docker and has 97.8% test coverage."*

### The Technical Details
*"The system uses FastAPI for the backend, LangChain for RAG orchestration, and FAISS as the vector store. I implemented multi-stage Docker builds for optimization, comprehensive pytest suite with 46 tests, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions. The frontend is built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience."*

### The Impact
*"I built this to solve a problem I personally had - learning AI Engineering was fragmented across many sources. This consolidates everything in one interactive platform. I use it myself, and it demonstrates both technical skills and teaching ability, which I believe is crucial for senior engineering roles."*
